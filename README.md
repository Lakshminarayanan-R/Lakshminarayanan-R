### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is lakshminarayanan

I started my career as a Mechaical Engineer. But I always loved coding and asking a lot of why's during my college days. At my first work, I was introduced to Data Analytics and there started my journey towards passion. I felt that I can finally love something I could do.
